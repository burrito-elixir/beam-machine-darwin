# BEAM Machine

This is a collection of scripts, templates, and configuration used to build many versions of Erlang for Linux and MacOS. These scripts may not be very useful to you on their own as they are built with the Burrito Erlang Build Server in mind. 

The Burrito Build Server is a Mac Mini M1 2020 with 8GB of RAM!
